# RISC-V MYTH Workshop – My Learning Journey

This repository documents my work from the **RISC-V MYTH (Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop**, organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** and **Redwood EDA**.

During the workshop, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing a RISC-V CPU:

## Key Learning Highlights

- **RISC-V Basics** – Explored the RV32I instruction set and understood how instructions map to hardware execution.
- **TL-Verilog** – Learned to use this modern, timing-abstract HDL to simplify pipeline and CPU design.
- **CPU Development** – Built a RISC-V core from scratch, integrating modules into a fully functional processor.
- **Pipeline Stages** – Implemented instruction fetch, decode, and execute stages for smooth instruction flow.
- **Datapath Design** – Developed register files and an ALU to handle arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Memory Operations** – Designed load/store logic while managing data alignment.
- **Control Flow** – Managed branches, jumps, and control hazards effectively.
- **Pipelining Techniques** – Optimized multi-stage pipelines and handled data/control hazards efficiently.
- **Testing & Simulation** – Verified CPU functionality using test programs and waveform analysis on Makerchip.

This workshop significantly strengthened my understanding of processor architecture and hardware design, while providing practical skills to **design, simulate, and analyze a fully functional RISC-V CPU**.
